100 REM Find SINCON and ATNCON Tables (FNDTBLE.BAS)
110 REM by Jim McClanahan, W4JBM (Sept. 2020)
120 REM
130 REM This program searches for the tables that ultimately create the
140 REM tables found by van den Assem and van Elk in their program KRAKINST.BAS.

160 REM This program is not at all elegant.
170 REM This program takes a long time to run.
180 REM To make it a bit less painful, this program does "assume"
190 REM      some pre-knowledge that the tables we are searching for are
200 REM      only about 250 bytes apart. Without that assumption, the time
210 REM      it takes to yield results is even longer.
